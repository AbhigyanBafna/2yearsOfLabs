# Prolog

<b> Introduction </b>
1. Prolog is a logic programming language. It has important role in AI. It is intended primarily as a declarative programming 
language.
2. Declarative programming is when you write your code in such a way that it describes what you want to do, not how you want 
to do it. It is left up to the compiler to figure out the how. Ex- Prolog, SQL.
3. In prolog, logic is expressed as relations (called as Facts and Rules) in a knowledge base. Knowledge bases has a .pl file extension.
4. Core heart of prolog lies at the logic being applied which is carried out by running a query over these relations.
