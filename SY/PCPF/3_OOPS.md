# Inheritance and Polymorphism

<b>Inheritance</b> is the capability of a class to derive properties from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is a feature 
or a process in which, new classes are created from the existing classes. The new class created is called “derived class”
and the existing class is known as the “base class”.

When we say derived class inherits the base class, it means, the derived class inherits all the properties of the base class, without 
changing the properties of base class. These new features in the derived class will not affect the base class. The derived class is the 
specialized class for the base class.

<b>Polymorphism</b> the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is 
a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. 
So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
<br>
1. <b>Compile-time (Overloading)</b> - When multiple objects are overloaded they can then behave differently for different inputs
hence polymorphism is achieved.
2. <b>Runtime Polymorphism</b> (Ovveriding) - When virtual functions are used they override the function in derived class and hence achieve polymorphism.
