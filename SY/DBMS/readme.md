## Data Definition Language(DDL)

* DDL commands are used to perform various operations on the structure/schema of the Database.
*  


## Data Manipulation Language(DML)

* DML commands are used to perform various operations on the data inside the Database.
*  


## Data Control Language(DCL)

* DCL commands are used to control various privilages to different users of the Database.
*  


## Transactional Control Language(TCL)

* TCL commands are used to control transactions in the Database. Assists in implementing ACID
properties.
*  


## Constraints

* Often we need to ensure that data in our database follows some set of rules specified by us.
Constraints let us to implement these rules on the data.
