# Python

1. Python is a high-level dynamically typed programming language.
3. It is majorly used in -
	1. Web and software development. <br>
	2. AI and Data Science
	3. Scripting.

## Why Python tho?

1. Python has a simple syntax allowing to write programs with fewer lines.
2. It runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. Making prototyping very quick.
3. Python relies on using whitespaces for various purposes which enhances readability compared to programming languages which often use something like curly-braces { }.

Python works with an interpreter and executing code line by line can get very slow. To overcome this we use a script file with the .py extension which executes all the code in one go.
