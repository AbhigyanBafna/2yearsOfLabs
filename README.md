Hey, Im Abhigyan and you'll find all the note-worthy knowledge structured beautifully below👇🏻. Unless I forgot to 
commit or was busy watching a marvel movie. Anyways, if you do have something that you think will enhance this repo. 
then by all means go ahead and <i><b>contribute!</b></i> I will probably add the `contributing.md` once I get the hang
of that. <br>
