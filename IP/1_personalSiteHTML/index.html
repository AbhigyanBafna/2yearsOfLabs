    <p>I am a student at <a href = "https://tsec.edu">Thadomal Shahni Engineering College</a> associated to the University of Mumbai. Aren't the feats achieved by 
       computers fascinating? I mean VR, astronomical calcuations, chess engines, artificial intelligence, folding phones, 
       flying cars... Seems like a dream world to me! Hence I am excited to learn to talk to machines and become an Engineer. 
       True Engineers, are very scarce in our world. A true Engineer (my perspective) is a calculating, knowledgable
       doer who solves problems efficiently and learns every byte from their mistakes.
